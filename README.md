![Geiger-Counter Front](pictures/front.jpg)

This is a DYI Geiger Counter with rechargable Akku and OLED-Display for overall costst of roundabout 45â‚¬.

----------

Based on an inexpensive kit from China, a Geiger counter for monitoring the radioactive ambient radiation was created.
The required electronic components are listed below. I provide the appropriate housing as a model for 3D printing on Thingiverse.
After completion, we recommend calibrating the device using a professional measuring device by adjusting the correction factor in line 48 of DIY_Geiger.ino.

## Software 
Because the NodeMCU is Arduino-compatible it can be programmed with any IDE for Arduino. Beside the Code-file propagated here there are some Standard-Arduino-libraries to use:

* Adafruit_GFX_Library
* Adafruit_SSD1306
* ESP8266WiFi (to disable WiFi for power save)
* SPI
* Wire
